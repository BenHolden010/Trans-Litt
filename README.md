# TransLitt
the App is deployed to this link: https://showcase-seven-delta.vercel.app/
## ABSTRACT
'Translitt' is a web application designed to provide users with millions od translations from 30 different languages. Through an intuitive interface, users can effortlessly type a word or phrse into the input field ans the App will auto detect the incoming language, then output the translation from the language that the user selects. 'Translitt' offers users 30 different languages to shoose from to be able to translate to their terget language and then have the translations automatically save to the saved translations page. if a user decides that they no longer need all of the translations then they can remove the translations using a deelete button. this information will only be stored while the user has not refreshed the applications page. 

## LEARNING GOALS
- Gain competency in react fundamentals and apply React and Cypress concepts effectively.
- Develop proficiency in testing React components and asynchronous JavaScript code, including the use of Cypress for end-to-end testing.
- Practice refactoring techniques to improve code quality, readability, and maintainability.
- Create a multi-page user experience using React Router to handle routing and navigation.
- Apply real-world API integration and handle network requests, including error handling and data fetching.
- Keeping track of a users saved translations and enabling them to delete their translations indevidually.

## WINS/CHALLENGES 
### WINS
- Being able to successfully learn and implement React within a few weeks to develop a comprehensive application by myself.
- Effective use of React to create a dynamic and interactive user interface, allowing users to navigate through different views and components.
- Utilization of React Router to handle routing and enable multi-page functionality, enhancing the user experience.

### CHALLENGES
- trying to get the post API to work was holding me up for an hour until i figured out that the error was occuring because of a typo in the fetch request.
- It was a challenge to have to find an API on our own and then work with it until our code was able to manipulate the returned data in a way that is user friendly.
